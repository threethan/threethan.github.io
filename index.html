        I'm a student and software developer. This simple website was created to host web apps,
        and to give a quick overview of some of the things I've worked on.

    <h1>Game Development</h1>
    I develop games in my free time, and have a few currently released on 
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ethan+M" class="play">Google Play</a>.
    Currently, all are written in customized versions of the Godot engine, and utilize
    native java code and libraries via plugins.

    mods and modding tools.

    </div>

    <h1>Custom CSS</h1>
    I'm a stickler for inconsistent or busy UI, so I've made a few custom CSS themes for applications
    I commonly use.
    <div class="block">

        with various UI and UX improvements for both platforms.

    <h1>Oculess Quest Utilities</h1>
    Meta's Oculess Quest devices run a customized and locked down version of Android 10.
    These tools aim to unlock additional functionality, allowing users the freedom to use
    the full potential of their headset.

    <div class="block">
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/basti564/Oculess" class="git">Background Audio</a></h2>
        Hooks system libraries to allow apps to play and record audio in the background, including
        voice chat and music during gameplay. This functionality was merged with the existing admin
        tool Oculess.

    <h1>Older Projects</h1>
    Some noteworthy projects from my highschool days. Some of these are a bit out of date, and
    none are actively maintained, but they all work nonetheless.
    <div class="block">
        <h2><a href="projects/Speech-Advisor-Web/index.html" class="app">Speech Advisor Web</a></h2>
        The web-app port of my team's 1st place project at Metrohacks III. Requires
        Chrome-specific speech recognition APIs, so it may not work on other browsers.

    <div class="block">
        <h2><a href="projects/portfolio-2020/index.html" class="app">Highschool Portfolio</a></h2>
        My old portfolio site from Highschool. Horribly out of date, but still a fun
        concept with sliding panes.
